        <h1>What is Version Control System (VCS)?</h1>
        <p>
            Version Control Systems are the software tools for tracking/managing all the changes made to the
            source code during the project development. It keeps a record of every single change made to the
            code. It also allows us to turn back to the previous version of the code if any mistake is made in 
            the current version. Without a VCS in place, it would not be possible to monitor the development of the project.
        </p>

        <h1>What is Git?</h1>
        <p>
            Git is a version control system which lets you track changes you make to your files over time.<br> 
            With Git, you can revert to various states of your files (like a time traveling machine). You can 
            also make a copy of your file, make changes to that copy, and then merge these changes to the 
            original copy.
