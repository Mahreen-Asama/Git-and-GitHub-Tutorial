        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Git and GitHub are two technologies that every developer should learn, irrespective of their field. 
            <br>
            This tutorial will help you understand what Git and version control are,
            the basic Git commands you need to know, how you can use its features to boost your work efficiency,
            and how to extend these features using GitHub.

        <h1>What is Version Control System (VCS)?</h1>
        <p>
            Version Control Systems are the software tools for tracking/managing all the changes made to the
            source code during the project development. It keeps a record of every single change made to the
            code. It also allows us to turn back to the previous version of the code if any mistake is made in 
            the current version. Without a VCS in place, it would not be possible to monitor the development of the project.
        </p>

        <h1>What is Git?</h1>
        <p>
            Git is a version control system which lets you track changes you make to your files over time.<br> 
            With Git, you can revert to various states of your files (like a time traveling machine). You can 
            also make a copy of your file, make changes to that copy, and then merge these changes to the 
            original copy.
        </p>

        <h1>Installation of Git</h1>
        <p>
            In order to use Git, you have to install it on your computer. To do this, you can download the 
            latest version on the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" id="official-site">official website.</a>
            <br> After installation, you can verify the current version of git installed on you PC, by running 
            following command on command line:
            <div id="git-version">git --version</div>. <br>
            The next thing you'll need to do is to set your username and email address. Git will use this 
            information to identify who made specific changes to files.<br>
            To set your username, type and execute these commands:
            <div id="username">git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"</div>
            <div id="password">git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"</div>
        </p>
        
    </div>
